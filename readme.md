This proyect is from [The odin project HTML and CSS course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/html-and-css/lessons/design-teardown).

I have made a greyscale heatmad of the layout of [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/)  in order to practise visual hierarchy, typography and design. <br>
The scale goes from black, the weightiest element, to white, the lightest element.
